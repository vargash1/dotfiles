#Dotfiles
Some of the configuration files I use on my system.

#Tmux Powerline
The colors I care about are in hex format. Thus in order for them to get to work on your system you will 
need a terminal that suppors truecolor. Tmux supports true color @ version 2.2. 
Most of the colors are taken from gruvbox, base 16, and from themes I found on terminal.sexy.
The icons I use are mostly from fontawesome. 



```bash
    git clone git@github.com:vargash1/dotfiles.git
```
